            Dear Mother,<br>

            About six hundred of Australian wounded [including myself] have arrived at the above address and all are in good spirits. Of course those who were very severely wounded were left at Alexandria and there was a great number of them too. But
            I believe I am starting at the wrong end, so will go back a little over a week when we were on board the “Malda” in Lemnos Island Harbour. I could go back even further than that to the time when we left Mena Camp [Feb. 28th] and sailed by
            the troopship “Ionian” to Lemnos Island, of our five weeks under canvas there and all our experiences, etc.; but I am afraid it would take too long and at present there is plenty of later news to write about.
            <br>
            Well, to resume my story – we were on board the Troopship “Malda” on Saturday, April 24th, waiting for British destroyers to take us to the place where we were to land and meet the Turks. At 10 p.m. we had our last meal on the “Malda” and
            somewhere about midnight, two destroyers came alongside and we were immediately transhipped to them. Previously to this though, the “Malda” had left Lemnos Harbour with us and taken a few hours trip to some place unknown. It was at this
            place that the destroyers joined us and our Company went on board the “Colne” and we steamed away from the “Malda” in the direction of the Dardanelles. We were all crowded on the deck, quite comfortable, and at 3 a.m. hot cocoa was served
            out to all hands. About this time the “Colne” stopped and it was 4.30 a.m. before she moved on again. We had not gone far before land could be seen ahead and we all then got into small boats which were alongside. The order was given to
            push off and make for land, just as day was beginning to break. The oarsmen gave way with a will and we were still 100 yards from shore when the exciting times commenced. There were six boat-loads of us and many others from other
            destroyers and cruisers all making for the shore at once.
            <br>
            The Turks must have been expecting us for their bullets began to fly all round the boats. Luckily not one in our boat was hit but others did not get off so well, for one fellow was killed and many were wounded. When our boat grounded we
            jumped out, almost up to the hips in water and made for the shore. It was my luck to step into a hole and I went almost under water, getting my rifle wet, but I managed to get to land otherwise unhurt. George Thomas was with us and gave
            the order to “Fix bayonets, open out and advance.” Ahead of us was a steep hill covered with thick undergrowth from 2 feet to 5 feet high and forming excellent cover for the enemy and also ourselves, but not bullet-proof. We got to the
            top of the first hill, about 100 feet high, in quick time and without mishap, the Turks retreating before us as we advanced. Ahead of us as far as we could see the country was all hills and gullies covered with the same thick undergrowth.
            <br>
            It was now broad daylight and as we forged onward an occasional bullet would whiz past unpledasantly close, but the enemy were poor rifle shots, for when we got to the top of the next hill only two had been wounded. We all got mixed up as
            we advanced owing to the nature of the country and I lost sight of most of my own mates. At this point not many of the enemy were opposed to us, although we came across many abandoned kit-bags and gear, as if they had left in a hurry. But
            on our left the firing was fairly heavy and continuous so the party I was with moved in that direction and we were soon in the thick of it. By this time many British battleships had opened fire on the Turkish forts and also on the enemy
            artillery, their shells flying over our heads and making an awful row. We drove the Turks back and captured four guns, many tents and ammunition, but reinforcements did not come up to us fast enough and we were forced to retire – but not
            for long. The enemy took up a strong position behind the top of a hill and there were many thousands of them including many German officers. They easily outnumbered us and had plenty of artillery and machine guns. All we had to depend on
            was our rifle fire and 1 or 2 machine guns so their advantage over us was indeed great. The fire of the enemy was absolutely murderous but our fellows advanced again and again and were dropping in all directions but would not be stopped.
            <br>
            That Sunday the Australians proved what stuff they were made of and many a one made a hero of himself, and many a poor fellow died urging his mates onward with his last breath. The hail of bullets was simply awful and the shrapnel shells
            were bursting round us all the time. They must have expended a marvellous amount of ammunition. Many of our officers were shot down and most of the time we got no orders at all but had to rely on ourselves and do the best we could. At any
            time we did happen to see an officer the order was always the same, “Get ahead, lads, and stick it into them.” Another advantage the Turks had over us was a thorough knowledge of the country and they had the ranges for their fire. And I
            suppose they were fresh too, but we had been up all the night before, got wet coming ashore and had had no breakfast, although we had food in our haversacks but had no time to eat it.
            <br>
            The Battalions were all mixed up and I saw very few of my own Coy.. Once I spotted Monty Woodyatt and gave him a call; he yelled out to me to come his way and we both forged ahead but got seperated almost immediately and I never saw him
            again. I heard later that he had been shot dead but do not yet know if it is true. Shortly after seeing Monty I joined Geo. Thomas and Billy Money behind some bush and the bullets were raining around us thick and fast. The cries of the
            wounded men about us were deadly and there were no stretcher-bearers about. Our position became too hot for us so Bill Money and I dashed ahead; I do not know how the bullets managed to miss us. We kept going ahead in short rushes and
            soon were almost near enough to resume firing again. As usual we were lying down behind bushes which formed a good cover but were not bullet proof. We had only been in this position a few minutes when I felt a thud in the back and
            afterwards found that a bullet had ripped the side of my haversack and tore a hole through a tin of “bully-beef” that I had in it. Our haversacks were strapped to our backs for convenience. It was a close shave but everyone was getting
            used to close shaves by then.
            <br>
            You know, Mother, it might sound like skite but I’m satisfied that the old tale that a soldier nearly dies of fright when first under fire is all bosh. I heard many of our fellows say the same thing. It makes you feel a bit uncomfortable
            but it also makes you want to get at the enemy and pay it all back with interest. There was one bad point about our fellows, they were too eager and rushed ahead in any sort of order, often exposing themselves unneccessarily. Within a
            minute of getting one in my haversack, I heard a groan beside me and saw Bill Money’s head drop. We were lying at full length on our stomachs. He said, “Ray, I’m hit” and I, with the aid of another chap who was near turned him over and
            got his equipment off. When I opened out his coat and shirt there was a bullet hole showing high up on his left breast, it might have been in the shoulder blade and very little blood was coming from it. Poor old Bill was almost
            unconscious and asked me if it had touched his heart. Of course I told him that it had not and that it would be alright. We managed to put on his “first field dressing” [one of which we all carry] and gave him a drink of water. We made
            him as comfortable as possible under the circumstances and I stacked his gear in front of his head so as to stop another bullet from hitting him. All the time I was expecting to get lobbed myself for the fire of the enemy was simply
            hellish. So fast and thick were the bullets coming that some of the time the sound of them was for all the world like the buzz of an electric fan – a continual hum. We had only just got Bill fixed when another chap on the other side of me
            was shot through the arm. The bullet must have cut an artery for when I cut open his sleeve the blood poured out and my hands were smothered in blood. We bound his arm as well as we could and told him to crawl to the rear. Two other chaps
            near us stopped bullets so I thought it was time to stop attending to wounded men for it is greatly against military rules for riflemen to stop to attend to wounds. Everyone unhurt was needed in the firing line, so I had another look at
            Bill Money who seemed quite unconscious and then retired a little to see if I could get any stretcher-bearers but there were none about and they were yelling out for more men so I joined a few chaps who were advancing and moved up with
            them. We went to the right of where I had left poor old Bill, so I did not see him again. Later in the day one of my Company told me he had seen Bill making his way towards the beach so I am in hopes that he is getting on alright. I would
            give anything to be sure of it.
            <br>
            As we advanced the fire, if possible, became hotter but I seemed to bear a charmed life, one bullet ripped through my left coat sleeve at the wrist without touching my arm. Shortly afterwards, when lying down, my water bottle stopped one
            and I lost all the water, which was a serious loss indeed. But I had a still narrower escape when a bullet tore through the collar of my tunic right under my chin. The badge must have turned it aside for there is a dent in it and a little
            bit of lead sticking to it. My collar was turned up a little for the bullet hit from the underneath side. I am thinking of cutting it off and sending it home to you for a keepsake.
            <br>
            It was not till about 3 p.m. that I was put out of action, when we were giving the Turks some hot fire and, of course, getting it hot in return. Their shrapnel was very deadly and we would hear the shells go whizzing over our heads and
            then go off with a bang. These shells contain hundreds of bullets and when they burst the bullets fly out. It was a shrapnel bullet that got me. A shell burst just a few yards to the left of me [I was lying down] and the sensation I got
            was as if someone had hit me with a large club full force on the muscle on the left arm. At the same time something hit me on the right forearm and left a black bruise there. My left arm was now useless and the blood was flowing freely so
            I thought it was time to retire and accordingly did so, dodging bullets all the time.
            <br>
            A few hundred yards back from the firing line I met one of our sergeants (what the hell’s the Sgt. doing there? D.B.) who put on my first field dressing. I saw then that a bullet had gone right through my arm near the shoulder, the hole
            in each side being about half an inch in diameter. I had nearly two miles to go to the beach – it was a deadly journey. I expected to get a few more gentle reminders from the beastly Turks for stray bullets were whistling about all the
            time. Anyway I got to the beach without further harm and now I am none the worse for my experience. It was hard luck to be put out of action the first day, but still I had about ten hours of it - and it was hot stuff,too. Some old
            soldiers who have been in action before say they have never seen or heard anything like it. They say there would be nothing in France to equal it.
            <br>
            It was a very severe day for the Australians and we suffered heavily. Colonel Lee [who was shot through the hand] was greatly cut up and was heard to exclaim, “Oh! My poor Ninth, my poor Ninth, they will be cut to pieces, they are bearing
            the brunt of it all.” The scene on the beach in the afternoon was awful – the doctors and ambulance men had their hands full; wounded men were lying everywhere. I saw George Thomas and Billy McGowan on the beach, both wounded in the
            shoulder, the former rather badly, I think. Even on the beach we were not too safe for the enemy were firing on the battleships and their shrapnel was bursting over us all the time. Unless you happened to be there you would hardly credit
            how marvellous were some of the escapes from death and the many different kinds of wounds showed that after all there are not many parts of the human body on which bullets prove fatal. One chap was shot right through the head, the bullet
            going in about an inch behind one eye and coming out an inch behind the other. He is not much the worse for it except that he has two lovely black eyes and they are nearly closed up, but his sight is not injured. There are many fellows
            with bullets still in their heads and they are doing alright. One poor chap was struck deaf and dumb by the bursting of a shrapnel shell close over his head but was otherwise unhurt. Another fellow who had half his face blown off just
            coolly finished himself off with his own rifle. A mate of his was with him at the time.
            <br>
            Dear Mother, I suppose you will think I am giving you too much of the horrors of war, but I thought you all would like to know all I could tell you about our first engagement. Here is one amusing incident to tone it down a little. A
            private was lying down behind cover near the firing line when someone else dashed up and dropped down beside him. The private noticed at once that he had no rifle so he roared at him, “What are you doing up here without a rifle you d-----
            fool.” The other fellow [who happened to be an officer] just calmly replied, “Officers don’t carry rifles, you d----- fool.” I suppose the private would feel rather small, that is, if he had time to.
            <br>
            As quickly as possible the wounded were taken off in boats – the very bad cases going to the Hospital ship and the others to the transport ships that were lying near. About 800 [including myself] were placed on board the Clan
            MacGillivary; the hospital ship was filled and two or three other troopships, so you can see there was a great number of wounded, somewhere about 5,000 I think. It was near 5 p.m. when we boarded the Clan Mac - and did not leave her till
            this morning. Since then we have, I mean since we went on board the Clan Mac - up till this morning, we have slept on the hard lower deck and lived on biscuits, cheese and jam.
            <br>
            You know, dear Mother, we first went to Alexandria where they found there would not be room for us so only the worse cases were taken off. The next morning after our arrival there, the “Clan Mac” turned tail with us and made for Malta. We
            all growled a bit at first at being cooped up on board for a few more days but now I am glad for the climate here will be miles better than Egypt. Mr. Thomas was taken off at Alexandria. Capt. Jackson was wounded but he was on some other
            boat. I do not think his was a bad case. Nearly all our officers were wounded and I believe 2 or 3 were killed.
            <br>
            Wed., May 5th. The Clan Mac dropped anchor in Malta harbour early yesterday morning and after breakfast we were taken ashore in lighters drawn by steam tugs. We are now quartered in barracks, 12 men being in each room and we are quite
            comfortable. I am on the 3rd Floor and there is a lovely view of the forts and the sea on one side and of the city on the other. We have electric light and plenty of water laid on and very convenient. The people are very kind and gave us
            a warm welcome. We are allowed to stroll about and yesterday many of us visited the English school, to the great delight of the kiddies, who seemed to think we were great heros. They pestered the life out of us for badges and foreign
            coins and gave us great bunches of lovely flowers. Our room looks quite gay with the flowers I got. We had quite a gay time with the youngsters and the school mistress [who is a bosker girl] could get no work out of them for the rest of
            the day.
            <br>
            Yesterday afternoon the school kids were going round with chocolates and cigarettes and also papers and magazines for the poor wounded Australians. This room in which I am writing was opened to us yesterday and paper, pens and ink
            supplied free – also soft drinks. The chaplain stationed here is a fine fellow and works hard for the entertainment of the soldiers as do also many of the ladies.
            <br>
            And now dear home folk, I hope I have not wearied you with such a long epistle – anyway I am just about at the end of my tether, but will write again soon. I have no idea how long I will be here but reckon my arm will be quite well in a
            fortnight or less, so if my luck is in I may be back at the front before you get this letter. It is a long time since I had a letter and goodness knows when we are likely to get another mail. But keep on writing for we may get them
            sometime or other. I only hope you are all enjoying the best of health and continue to do so and that this letter reaches you alright. We have been told that these letters will not be censored. While at Alexandria I sent you a p.c.
            written in a hurry.
            <br>
            Well, good-bye dear Mother, with the best of love to you all. Hope Dad is in good nick, also the girls and Herb. I would very much like to know if you got the news of the Australians fighting at Gallipoli and what the papers said about
            it. I think we did our duty.<br>

        <p>The "Big Push"</p>
        <a href="javascript:toggleView('bat-02')">Somewhere in France, July 30th. 1916</a>
        <article class="letter-style" id="bat-02">
          <p>
            Dear Mother,
            <br>
            Now that we are resting after the horrors and hardships of a few days in the “Big Push” I must try and tell you some of the news. I have sent several “field cards” and one or two short letters and hope they reached you safely.
            <br>
            Starting from where I left off after having breakfast near Beauval, we marched on through Bonneville and billeted at the village of Halloy-Pernois, altogether a 13 mile march. At 10.30 a.m. the next day we again started off, passed the
            village of Havernas and billeted at Naours, this day only a five mile tramp. At Naours we stopped for four days having a quiet time, while there we visited some famous Catacombs less than half a mile from our billet and found them very
            interesting. It was much like being down a mine only the entrance is at the base of a big hill. These Catacombs are supposed to be 550 years old and were once chalk pits, there are passages, tunnels, dug-outs, traverses, stairways,
            airshafts, and ups and downs in all directions and it would be easy to get lost. In different places there are relics of all sorts behind wire netting and bars, statues of Christ on the Cross, brass candlesticks, Virgin Mary, etc.. All
            over the walls persons have written their names and we saw John Norton’s who edited the “Sunday Truth”, underneath he had added “Sydney, Australia”, our guide pointed it out to us.
            <br>
            At midday Sunday, July 16th we moved out of Naours, marched through Palmas village and billeted at a large farm on the outskirts of Rubempre. As usual we were put into the barn to sleep and as it had been a long march we were glad to rest
            in the straw. At this place food was not too plentiful, that is, other than the ordinary army rations, and one or two chaps bought all there was, leaving many of us with money in our pockets and empty tummies. Our Sergeant was one of the
            lucky ones, but was foolish enough to go out and leave a hat full of cakes on his bunk and you know “opportunity makes the -----“ but I set fair exchange example by taking two cakes and putting 2 pennies in the hat and was promptly
            followed by others so that in about “two ups” there were more pennies than cakes. I must draw a veil over the rest of the tale – poor Sergeant Scott. We were two nights at this farm and then again started "foot slogging", the villages we
            passed through were – Herrincort, Toutencourt, Harponville and Varennes, and we stopped at Hedauville for the night.
            <br>
            The next day our packs were collected and stowed away and we left Hedauville carrying only overcoat and oilsheet, so we knew that we were getting nearer the fray. The whole of the 3rd Brigade were on the move and our Company rested on the
            outskirts of “Boozincourt” while all the Battalions marched past. It was a great sight and you would have thought the men were going to a picnic instead of into the thickest of the fighting on the whole British Line. That same afternoon
            we marched through the town of Albert and bivouaced a few hundred yards the other side. Albert is a fine large city, now almost empty of civilians and has been knocked about muchly by the Huns’ shells, especially the cathedral. On the top
            of the spire is a large gilded figure of the Virgin Mary holding in her arms the form of Christ as a child. Originally it pointed to the sky but owing to the effect of the German shells it is now leaning over at right angles – the figure
            itself being uninjured and it appears as if Christ was being offered to the people. It presents a strange and curious sight, especially when standing directly underneath – to see this overhanging image a couple of hundred feet up. You may
            have heard of it or seen a photo of it.
            <br>
            That night I was one of a party of twelve to go up to the firing line with some of the Coy’s gear. It was a long and weary tramp, but we eventually, after being lost several times, found our way to Contalmaison where we left the stuff and
            got back to camp at 6 a.m. next morning. I managed to get a few hours sleep and in the afternoon we all packed up and moved up as far as the old British firing line, from where the “Big Push” started. This was Thursday, July 20th. Here we
            slept for two nights and spent most of our time exploring the German’s old firing line and dug outs – the latter being in some cases 30 feet (9+ metres) underground and well furnished. Judging by the state of the trenches and the ground
            round about, the Germans must have had a very hot time – their barb-wire was torn to shreds, parapets levelled to the ground, enormous shell holes overlapping each other and equipment and stores strewn everywhere in hopeless confusion.
            The Pioneers and Salvage Corps had not had time to attend their work so we noticed many dead Huns about , some half buried under the ruins of their trenches, others in the open and here and there a leg or an arm sticking out of a smashed
            dug out.
            <br>
            On the Saturday afternoon, after handing in our overcoats, we started for the firing line, the waggons taking our gear part of the way. We had to carry it the rest and for nearly three hours we toiled along through communication trenches.
            It was deadly work and everyone swore it was the worst time they ever had, in fact one of our chaps [Bob Wood] fainted from exhaustion. The way was new to us, the night was dark, in places we were up to our knees in mud, had to walk over
            dead men and just got in to be told to get our guns in position as the attack was to start in 15 mins. I must not tell you, dear Mother, all the horrors of that night, it would sicken you – Gallipoli was a home in comparison and for the
            following few days and nights it was fast and furious, attack and counter attack, dead, dying and wounded lying about, no possibility of sleep; it was indeed a shambles but how gloriously our men fought and how nobly the stretcher-bearers
            worked. Many prisoners were brought in and they looked scared out of their lives.
            <br>
            The “Big Push” is good to read of but to be in it is Hell and yet I am glad to be able to say I was there and never shirked. Our Company suffered severely as did all the Batts. in the 1st Division. What a great relief it was to us when we
            came out, both physically and mentally exhausted – the nerves of many were completely gone – it was pitiful to see big men collapse and cry like babies; we were all rather shakey but it was nothing to be ashamed of for it was a great test
            of human endurance. We can look back at it now and feel glad that we were successful and we feel that next time we will do equally as well – it cannot be worse anyway, Now we are having a good rest and I am in good health, eating like a
            horse and feeling fit for anything.
            <br>
            All I have to worry about is how the dear ones at home are getting on. Our march back from the fray was done in easy stages, via Albert, Warloy-Baillon, Vadencourt, Toulencourt, Herrisart, Val De Maison, Naours, Halloy to Berthancourt. I
            received a letter from you dated end of May yesterday, it was very welcome, glad you got the parcels I sent and hope the money is alright. Remember me to T.W., he has my sympathy [3 oh lor].(probably the birth of his third child, oh
            Lord!). Will write again soon, hope you get this alright.
            <br>
            Best of love, dearest of Mothers, from your loving son,<br><br>

            Ray.

            Dear Herb,

            It is the Sabbath day and for a wonder we are having a rest so I have time to write a few lines while reclining in my billet which at some remote period was a fowl-house. But we are accustomed to all sorts of conditions now and learn to
            make the best of things however severe they may be. For some time now we have been on the move from one village to another, rarely stopping at one place for more than a few days. We see a great deal of the country but would enjoy it more
            if we had less to carry. Of course you will have read much about the Australians being in the “Big Push” but the papers could not convey any idea of the real truth of such hellish fighting as we were in at Pozieres. I have written to
            Mother three times since I came out and hope the letters arrived alright, giving her some sort of an account of things. Our fellows have fought marvellously well, gaining all their objectives but at a great cost and the casualty lists, if
            published in the Australian papers will be a great blow to the people. Our Division [the 1st] which was the first of the Australians to take part in the push had about 9,000 casualities and the 2nd Division suffered just as much. For the
            few days we were in it, it was hell on earth, practically no sleep, little to eat and shells of all sorts and all sizes being pelted at us day and night. Dead and wounded lay on all sides and there was blood everywhere, in one part of the
            trench where there had been hand to hand fighting, we noticed among the dead an Australian, his hands gripping a German by the throat while the latter had his arms around the other’s body – both were dead, had been killed by a bomb while
            struggling together. The many sights we saw would make your blood curdle, they were too awful for me to describe, but there were many heroic incidents which made me feel glad that I am British. Our bombers for instance did great work. On
            the second morning of our stunt the Huns were holding a bit of trench that we wanted and they were very hard to shift, so the officer of the bombers spoke to his men, “Will we shift them, lads?”, “Right ho, sir” was the answer and they
            hopped out over the parapet, 20 or 30 of them, in the face of shells and machine gun fire, raced across to the enemy trench and standing there in broad daylight they pelted their bombs with great coolness. It was a great bit of work and
            we kept up machine gun fire over their heads during the scrap. The trench was won, most of the occupants being killed, and of course, our chaps suffered too. This is only one little incident, the stretcher bearers toiled and sweated for
            all they were worth under very severe conditions. Our Coy had sixteen guns in action and the only one we lost was the one I was on – the Hun’s artillery had the range to a T and lobbed over gas shells, tear shells, high explosives,
            shrapnel, etc. from 18 pounders to 9.2 inch. It was “No Bon”. Our team consisted of 5 men and 1 officer. The officer and 1 man were wounded and 2 men killed. It was hard luck but such things are to be expected.

            Well anyway, dear Herb, all that is over now and we are satisfied that things can be no worse. The 4th Division are now in and we may relieve them soon. At present we are at the village of Bonneville waiting for orders, having a quiet
            time so – what’s the use of worrying as long as we are in good health.. I hope all at home are in the best of health also, yourself and the girls. I have written to Mrs. McCathie, you will hear the news from her not included here. I will
            also be writing home again soon. Fancy you saying – “Vouley-vous promenade, mademoiselle.” She might reply, “Oui monsier, merci.” Tres Bon, eh? I hope Will Raymond and family are well, give them my love and also remember me to any other
            friends. Could you let me know if home affairs are settled up yet and how Mother is and the girls. I am afraid many letters have miscarried.

            Well, hooray old chap, love to all from,
            <br><br>
            Ray.
            <br>
            We are going to win. D.R.B.
